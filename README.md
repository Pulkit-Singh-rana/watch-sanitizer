# watch-sanitizer
 To avoid CVOID-19 infection our Ministry of health have advised to use face masks and hand sanitizer ;and avoid hand shakes and touching our own face. But as we know these things are hard to remember, for this purpose i have designed a device which can remind us to regularly sanitize our hands and not to touch our face.
